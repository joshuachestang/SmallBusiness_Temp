<h1>Small Business Template</h1>
<p>This is my small business template layout.</p>
<p>The perpouse of this is to set a base for a developer to build from.</p>
<p>This Template is filled with the following Gems:</p>
<ul>
	<li><%= link_to "PG", "https://rubygems.org/gems/pg" %> => Postgrsql insted of Mysql for the database</li>
	<li><%= link_to "Twitter Bootstrap", "https://github.com/anjlab/bootstrap-rails" %> => Responsive and CSS layout </li>
	<li><%= link_to "Clearance", "https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance" %> => Thoughtbot authentication gem</li>
	<li><%= link_to "Paperclip", "https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip" %> => Thoughtbot file upload gem</li>
	<li><%= link_to "Dropbox", "https://github.com/janko-m/paperclip-dropbox" %> => Dropbox is used with paperclip as a storage space</li>
	<li><%= link_to "Mail_Form", "https://github.com/plataformatec/mail_form" %> => This is to make creating contact or information request forms easy</li>
	<li><%= link_to "Mailcatcher", "https://rubygems.org/gems/mailcatcher/versions/0.5.12" %> => Allows for sending of email on local host for testing</li>
</ul>
<p>I have also set <em>config.serve_static_assets = true</em> to true so that if you are using heroku it will play nice.</p>

<p>As I find more use full and time saving gems I will update them here. Not all gems are fully install some of these gems are just listed and ready for 
	me to comepleat the intallation if it is needed.</p>

<p>Built into this template is an Admin Dashboard. Just something vary basic to allow the developer or client to edit the content
	and images / files on their site.</p>
	
<p>This is by no means a full CMS and at this time is not my intent. I just wanted to make implementing	additional sites fast and easy
	while at the same time allowing my client the easy ability to update their site with out having to learn new software or remember 
	how things work down the road.</p>

<p>If you are a developer and like what you see here fell free to cloan it and use to your harts content. Or if you are looking for a RoR CMS and 
	think this would be a good start then lets talk. If you have a gem that you thing would be of good use here let me know and I will look it over
	and consider adding it.</p>
